Data wrangling (15 points)

-Did not provide a clear explanation of what the variables are that are used in the analysis 

-Did not show data wrangling, or describe that the data was already clean

-Did not explain your resonating behind removing outliers/did not remove outliers that are due to errors

Data visualization (20 points)

-Visual appearance of graphs could be improved; i.e., missing labels, poor color choices, etc. 

-Further graphical methods should have been explored 

-Plot does not add any insight into the question of interest 

-Jumped right into the analysis without properly visualizing the available variables 

-Did not provide a written describe of the insights that the graphs provide

```
Results modeling (25 points)

-Did not check assumptions for analyses 

-Did not describe model fit or consider transformations 

-Would benefit from an additional test/analysis 

-Inappropriate model used for the data being analyzed

-Analyses do not address the question of interest 

-Code is not neat or well commented 

-Falls short for a two-person project

Has limitations that should have been either been taken into account or mentioned

Conclusions (15 points)

-Conclusions reiterates test results with no significant insight given; i.e., does not describe how results address question of interest, why the are interesting, or put them into context.
